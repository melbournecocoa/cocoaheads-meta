# Melbourne Cocoaheads running sheet notes

## Before you head to the event
- You might want to bring your iOS/HDMI adapter and the Mini Display Port -> HDMI adapter just in case. If not, someone in the audience always has one.
- Take your MAC, and power adapter (You never know when you might need it).

## Setup
- Delivering the drinks to the room around 6ish
- Direct some of the early arrivers to help setup the chairs while you setup the AV gear
- Direct helpers to unpack the drinks for everyone else (often they need a nudge). 

## Refreshments
- Pizzas are scheduled for 7:30, make sure your number is on call for those. Grab whoever you need to get them back to the room.

## MC notes
- The speakers are outlined in the #pragma mark slides
- Don't worry about recording unless there's a super easy way to use an iPhone on the night
- Given we have TMTW and one presentation prior to pizzas aim to get TMTW kicked off by 6:40~6:45.
- "Who's hiring" goes right before pizzas
- If the pizzas arrive before the first main presentation is over, don't worry - pizzas can sit for ~15/20 minutes no worries
- Try to start the next presentation by 8-8:15pm then move onto the lightning talks right away. (the night gets stale about 9:30ish) 
- We've never cut a lightning talk short, but let them know up front that they've for 5-10 minutes if you think they're going to waffle.

## Packing up
- Appoint someone to help deal with the left over drinks, also deal with the ice buckets.
